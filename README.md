# Weather-AUS-Data
This dataset(Weather-AUS.csv) contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
By using this dataset we are going to perform some Datascience related operations.i.e
Cleaning of dataset(removing null values,outliers and unwanted data).
Standardixation and Normalization of data.
Performimg hypothesis tests.
Finding the correlations between the variables.
For better understanding refer my 'Explaination.pptx'. I explained the coding and dataset line by line.
